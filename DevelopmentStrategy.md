# Development Strategy
The purpose of this document is to capture the basic rules and guidelines to follow when working in this repository.  It is expected everyone follows the rules, however, the guidelines are flexible and people should make use of common sense when deciding when to follow or break away from the guideline.

## Git Strategy
Source code management is a vital component of software development.  A disorganized and chaotic repository will ultimately lead to a number of bugs being introduced, reintroducing old bugs, wasted effort by the development team, and ultimately a low quality product.

The strategy below is intended to be a set of **rules** to be followed by everyone.

This project follows the *Feature Branch Workflow* as described by [Atlassian Bitbucket](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow) and [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/workflow/workflow.html), I don't know where the original idea came from but Bitbucket has a very nice overview of it while GitLab demonstrates (very quickly) which commands to run.

## Coding Standards
For the most part the coding standards are rules.
